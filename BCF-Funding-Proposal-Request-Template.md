# ![BCF Logo Round Tiny](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/The-Bitcoin-Cash-Fund/Branding/master/BCF%20Symbol%20Round%20Tiny.png) BCF Funding Proposal Request Template


**Project Name:** ezXch8nger


**Start Date:** github repo 28.11.2017


**Hashtag:** #bitcoincashxchngr


**Name of BCF Gitter community room:** ezXch8nger


**Stakeholders:** 
only me right now


**Project Summary:** 

1)I am located in Malaysia and like many other countries crypto is still very new and beginning to get some traction. The only possible way to get into crypto right now is via bank trasnfer to a service provider wallet (i.e luno etc) and vice versa. The third party usually has presence here in Malaysia and has set up a company and bank account to receive those funds. Usually if not most of the time these wallets offer fiat->BTC and BTC->fiat conversion and direct bank transfers. So far there isnt one that accepts BitcoinCash Fiat conversions.

2)Recently, the Central Bank of Malaysia, released a statement saying that they will regulate the exchange from crypto to fiat by appointing "individuals" to comply with AML reguations. In Malaysia we have what we call traditional Money Changers, who are in essence small business owners who offer fiat currency exchange, you could go to a bank too, but these money changers are found almost everywhere and convenient, and on top of that they are already licensed and follow strict Central Banks procedures.

3)The project is to work with these traditional money changers and offer them a platform to conduct BitcoinCash conversions to fiat as an added service.
